workflow v1
Personalized Work scheduler to keep me organized and have a routine. I spent one week working on this project but I am still working on improving it. 
Key Features: It uses OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather and Twilio to send messages to my phone to remind me of certain things. 
This is very useful to me and makes my life a little more easier, especially with my packed school schedule. I'm hoping in the future I will be able to update this and release a v2.
