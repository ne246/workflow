workflow v1

Personalized Work scheduler to keep me organized and have a routine. I spent one week working on this project but I am still working on improving it. 
An issue I always ran into was not seeing my schedule for the week visually, especially for classes, I constantly have to log in to my school app to see where the class is and what time it starts. So decided to fix that for myself.

Key Features: Gives you the ability to add, remove, and edit tasks throughout the week and see what is there for the current day. It also uses OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather and Twilio to send messages to my phone to remind me of certain things. 

This is very useful to me and makes my life a little more easier, especially with my packed school schedule. I'm hoping in the future I will be able to update this and release a v2. 

Note: I'm still a beginner coder and learning to improve my skills
